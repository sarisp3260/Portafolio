      longDesc: "I am a bilingual web developer with experience in projects especially with Scrum methodologies. I am hard-working as an individual but also as a team worker, always friendly and polite, but more importantly I am willing to constantly learn new skills. Something to say about me is I am able to listen effectively to follow up and solve problems. I have worked in responsive web design and programming, in different parts of the process but I could say that my main skill is in the front-end. So enthusiastic to work together, then feel free to get in touch with me.",
